A high-performance training framework for Stable Diffusion XL that implements cutting-edge research advances in diffusion model training. This framework focuses on memory efficiency, training stability, and convergence speed.

## Key Research Implementations

### Advanced Training Dynamics

#### Flow Matching with Logit-Normal Sampling
- Implements the nyaflow-xl approach [[4]](#references) which uses logit-normal time sampling
- Provides better gradient flow and faster convergence compared to standard uniform sampling
- Reduces training instability through optimal transport path computation
- Enables direct velocity field learning without noise schedule dependencies

#### NovelAI V3 UNet Improvements [[7]](#references)
- v-prediction parameterization for more stable gradients
- Zero Terminal SNR (ZTSNR) training:
  - Uses high sigma_max (~20000) to approximate infinite noise
  - Improves sample quality by better handling high-noise regions
  - Reduces artifacts in generated images
- Karras noise schedule implementation:
  - Dynamic sigma spacing for better noise coverage
  - Improved training stability at high noise levels


### Data Processing Pipeline

#### Dynamic Tag-Based Loss Weighting [[5]](#references)
- Implements importance sampling based on tag frequencies
- Automatic weight computation for balanced training
- Support for hierarchical tag categories
- Cache system for efficient weight lookup

#### High-Performance Data Loading
- NVIDIA DALI integration for GPU-accelerated preprocessing
- Multi-GPU preprocessing pipeline with load balancing
- Efficient aspect ratio bucketing system
- Asynchronous data prefetching and caching

### Training Infrastructure

#### Distributed Training
- Efficient DistributedDataParallel (DDP) implementation
- Gradient synchronization optimization
- Automatic batch size scaling
- Multi-node training support

#### Monitoring and Validation
- Comprehensive metric tracking
- Automated checkpoint management
- Dynamic validation scheduling
- Weights & Biases integration

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sdxl-training.git
   cd sdxl-training
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/WSL
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare configuration:
   ```bash
   cp src/config.yaml my_config.yaml
   ```

2. Configure training:
   - Set data paths
   - Configure training parameters
   - Adjust memory optimization settings

3. Start training:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py --config my_config.yaml
   ```

## Configuration

The framework uses a hierarchical YAML configuration system:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `global_config` | General settings and paths |
| `model` | Model architecture and parameters |
| `training` | Training loop configuration |
| `data` | Dataset and preprocessing settings |
| `tag_weighting` | Caption-based loss weighting |

See [`src/config.yaml`](src/config.yaml) for a complete example.
